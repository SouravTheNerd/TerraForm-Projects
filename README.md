# Terraform Azure Projects

Welcome to my Terraform Azure Projects repository! This repository documents my journey as I learn and implement various projects using Terraform on Microsoft Azure. My goal is to share my experiences and the knowledge I gain along the way, so that others can benefit from it and easily follow along.

## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision resources in cloud environments using a declarative configuration language. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, providing a wide range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications.

In this repository, I will be:

- Exploring different Azure services
- Creating and managing infrastructure using Terraform
- Writing detailed documentation for each project

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can expect to find in this repository:

1. **Basic Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Setup**
   - Creating a VNet with subnets, route tables, and network security groups (NSGs)

2. **Deploying Virtual Machines (VMs)**
   - Provisioning VMs with custom configurations and managing their lifecycle

3. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster**
   - Setting up an AKS cluster and deploying containerized applications

4. **Azure Storage Account**
   - Creating and managing storage accounts for different use cases

5. **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform and Azure DevOps

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need:

- An Azure account
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Azure and Terraform

## How to Use This Repository

Each project will have its own directory with the following structure:

```
project-name/
  ├── main.tf
  ├── variables.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  ├── README.md
```

The `main.tf` file contains the main Terraform configuration, `variables.tf` defines input variables, and `outputs.tf` specifies the output values. The `README.md` file in each project directory provides detailed instructions on how to set up and deploy the project.
